# K_BF
OpenHPSDR Audio I/O board, Andromeda/CPU/Hermes interface

K_BF aka Kêtos

This card is an interface between 

- the IDC10 output connector of "audio" signals (HP/headphones, microphone/PTT, CW key) coming from the Andromède board

- the audio input/output jack connectors going to the embedded computer

- the input/output jack connectors of the main SDR board (Hermes/Angelia/Orion) using the OpenHPSDR standard.

Ketos is the name of the sea monster that Perseus slays to deliver Andromeda... 

Andromeda is the high-end "human to machine interface" of the OpenHPSR architecture.
